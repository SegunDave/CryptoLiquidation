# CryptoLiquidation
Liquidation in financial market, Forex, stocks or cryptocurrencies tend to have a noticeable impact in the financial market. Hence this tool is aimed at tracking total liquidation or individual liquidation per timeframe. API is provided by https://www.coinglass.com/

There is no proven or thoroughly backtested way to use market liquidation data in predicting the market flow. Thus, I would recommend this tool be used for testing purpose only and not as a whole strategy in making a financial decision.
